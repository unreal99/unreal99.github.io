		 <h1>How to Choose a Garage Door </h1>
		 <p>You want to make a good decision about your garage door but you may not be certain how to do so. We are here to help you make the right decision about the garage door that you’ll have installed. Since you have to see this door every day, great care and consideration should be given to the type of door to have installed. If you want to make sure that your home has curb appeal, it will be important that you take your time to make sure you're going to receive the right door for your home.</p>
		 <p> There are many factors to consider, such as environment, use, and cost. It doesn't matter if you're looking for a new door because the one you have is old and dated or if you simply want to replace door to give your home more appeal. Regardless of the type of garage door, you have installed, it should meet the needs of your household. </p>
		 <h3>The Types of Doors </h3>
		 <p>The construction of your door or the type of door that you choose to have installed is likely going to be based on the type of weather you experience in the area you live, the cost of the door and how frequently the door will be used.  </p>
		 <h3>Types of Garage Doors </h3>
		 <ul>
		 	<li><i>Fiberglass</i><br> 
This is one of the most popular types of garage doors because of their ability to hold up against the worst weather. Since the climate will vary based on where a person lives, it helps to have a door that is flexible enough to withstand most weather, no matter how bad it is.</li><br>
<li><i>Wood</i><br> 
This type of door is often chosen because of its design aesthetics. Due to the beautiful appearance of most wood doors, you’ll be expected to pay more. Those homeowners who choose to have this type of garage door installed are willing to spend the money to have a door as attractive as a wood door. </li><br>
<li><i>Metal</i><br> 
You will often find this type of door, along with aluminum and steel doors in regions where there are very high winds. This is because they are not easy to damage due to bad weather. They generally will last longer than any other type of garage door and are offered in different colors to suit your taste preference. </li><br>
<li><i>Size</i><br> 
When deciding on which type of door to have installed, you’ll have to measure the area. Measure the width, height and thickness needed. When you have the measurements, bring them with you so that we can make sure we are able to provide you with the right door. </li><br>
<li><i>Style</i><br> 
The style that you choose is based on your personal preferences. There are often four main types of panel designs that are offered: </li>
		 </ul>
<p><strong>1. Flush panels</strong> – They lay flat against the door and are textured slightly. The design is subtle enough to add interest but not take away from the appearance of the actual door. </p>
<p><strong>2. Carriage panels</strong> -  They add interest to raised panels found often on traditional garage doors. </p>
<p><strong>3. Short Raised panels</strong> – We install this feature on Victorian-style houses since they add depth. They have very keen trim, which improves the overall look of the style of the home. </p>
<p><strong>4. Long Raised panels</strong> – They also offer depth to the door, improving the appearance of the home that the garage is attached to. </p>
<h3>Most Common and Affordable Garage Door </h3>
<p>It is the steel garage door that is used most often because of its durability, styles, and cost. This type of door can even be painted to suit the needs of the homeowner. The steel door is constructed in three distinct ways: </p>
<p>1. Single-layer doors use a single sheet of galvanized steel to design. This one is the most economical of all three. </p>
<p>2. Double-layer doors are made with a single sheet of galvanized steel on the exterior and a layer of polyurethane to support it. The layer offers soundproofing and insulation benefits. </p>
<p>3. Triple-layer doors are designed the same way that the double-layer door are but with another layer of galvanized backing to protect the polyurethane. This makes it the most durable of all three types of doors. 
</p>
	
<p>If you’re interested in investing in a new garage door or simply having some improvements made to your existing garage door, you should know what you can add to the door to give it more curb appeal. You can change the entire appearance of your garage door with these added features. </p>	 
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hardware</strong><br> 
Hardware can consist of knobs, panels, and windows added onto the front of the garage door to change its appearance. You can even have certain types of garage doors painted. </li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the garage doors that you will choose today offer the ability to add home automation to them. This makes it easier for you to get the most from your newly installed garage door. The automation offered today enables you to open and close your garage door with the touch of a button. You can even monitor your garage remotely with new home automation systems offered today. Based on the type of home automation system you have, you can even be notified when your garage door is not completely closed.  This enables you to protect your belongings by closing it remotely. </p>
<h3>Garage Door Service and Installation </h3>
<p>It is up to each individual homeowner to do their research before they have their garage door installed or new features added to their existing door. This will certainly save you a lot of time and frustration in planning ahead. No matter what type of garage door you choose to have installed, the most important thing you can do is choose the right <a href="../../index.html">garage door service</a> to install it for you.
